## 🚀 About Me

🔭 Hello! I am a software developer with a passion for technology and innovation at www.bytecrafter.co Currently, I lead as CEO the Cuántica Magazine, www.cuantica.xyz where we explore 📝 the geopolitical limits of science and technology.
🌐With experience in application and systems development, I have had the privilege of working on projects that have positively impacted the people involved. My focus is on creating  solutions that are not only efficient, but also intuitive and user-centered.
🔭 When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me immersed in the pages of a good book, exploring new worlds and fascinating perspectives. Additionally, running is my escape,  
📝 where I find mental clarity and energy to face new challenges.
✍️ I love connecting with industry professionals, sharing knowledge, and exploring new opportunities. Don't hesitate to contact me to talk about technology, science, or any exciting 
🌐 topic that moves us!
