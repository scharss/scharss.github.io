This project is a website template designed for software developers to showcase their work and skills in a professional and engaging way.

## How can I customize it?

To customize this portfolio with your personal information, simply edit the following files:

- **`index.html`**: Here you can modify text content, such as your name, project descriptions, work experience, and contact information.
- **`style.css`**: In this file, you can change the colors, fonts, and any other visual aspects to suit your personal style.
- **Images**: Replace the images in the assets folder with your own photos or those of your projects.
